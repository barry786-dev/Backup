# React Practice Test
Use create-react-app. For each problem, create a separate branch. 

### 1. Nested Lists

Create an array of 4 author objects.  Each author object should have a name and a books key.  The value of the books key should be an array of titles.  Use this array of author objects to display a nested list of authors and their books on the page.  

Resource: [Lists and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### 2. Shift Right

Create a button that says "Shift right".  Center the button both horizontally and vertically on the page. Repeatedly clicking the button should move a rectangle large enough to cover the button from the left margin of the page across the button to the right margin of the page.  Each click should shift the rectangle by 50px.  For this task you should:

-   Create a state variable to hold the value of the transformation points.
-   Handle an event which increments or decrements the transformation points.
-   Bind the transformation using inline CSS to the created rectangle.

### 3. Fetch Data

-   Create a React state variable to hold data that you fetch from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API. 
-   Make the API request and store the data
-   Render the returned data
