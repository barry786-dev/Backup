            Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art whose
            central theme is the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in
            ways that force him to submit. Due to the fact that control is
            generally easier on the ground than in a standing position, much of
            the technique of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is centered around the
            skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for
            dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered
            harmless. <br /><a href="./posts/post1.html">Read more...</a>

            Kyokushin Karate is famous for being one of the “harder” substyles
            of Karate. This style of Karate allows full contact sparring
            (kumite) and does not use any protective gear, except for a mouth
            guard and groin protection. They do not even use gloves or
            protective headgear during tournament sparring events. Kyokushin
            does not practice Olympic-style “sports” sparring. Kyokushin kumite
            allows kicks against an opponent’s head, body and legs. It also
            allows knee strikes and punches to an opponent’s body (but not to
            their head).<br /><a href="./posts/post2.html">Read more...</a>

            Muay Thai, which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is the national sport
            of Thailand. It is a martial art with roots originating from
            military use dating back to around the 13th century during the time
            of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Muay Thai is known as the “Art of 8 limbs”
            because it makes use of 8 points of contact namely, punches, elbows,
            knees and kicks. This differs it from other stand-up combat sports
            such as boxing (2 points - fists) and karate (4 points - fists and
            feet). Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in
            Thailand, but also all around the world.<br /><a
