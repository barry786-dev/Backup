> - The most obvious difference from **a class and an object** is that **classes** serve only one purpose, they are the template from which objects inherit properties and functionality. **A class** is like a blueprint from which a house is built.

> - In JavaScript there are no classes. Instead, **each object can function as a class**, meaning that every object can be useful in two ways: as a template for other objects, and as an object in its own right.

> - **An object** is a collection of functions and data. **A function** is a collection of commands and data. When a bunch of functions work together to perform a certain task we may call this community of functionality an object.

> - Traditionally in Object oriented Programming, when a function is part of an object, it is called **a method**. But a method can be more than a function, **a method** is a set of functionality that acts to enhance an object. Sometimes a method has more than one function inside of itself and therefore we canâ€™t really say that methods and functions are synonymous. Their classification can have different meanings, such as one function, or a set of functions coming together to create a method for an object.

> - To make things more complex, **in JavaScript a function is also an object** since almost everything in JavaScript is an object in its own right.
